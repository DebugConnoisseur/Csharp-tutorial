//Console.WriteLine command is used for printing things on the console, here we are printing hello world
//Every command in C# should end with a semicolon
Console.WriteLine("Hello World");

//You may notice that the console closes immediately and you may not be able to see the output so to counter this leave a Console.ReadLine command

Console.ReadLine();
  
//Now, the console stays still until you type in something in the console
